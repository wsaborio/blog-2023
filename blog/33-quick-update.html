		<h1>33. Quick update</h1>
		<p class="date" style="color: #999">2023-07-16</p>

		<p>I haven't been writing or updating this blog as frequently as I have the last few months. The main reason is I've taken on a new role recently on the go-to-market team at OpenAI. There I'm partnering with the world's leading companies and developers to bring AGI's benefits to all of humanity.</p>
		<p>OpenAI is an incredibly exciting and important place to be right now. The pace of growth is unprecedented, the depth of talent is unparalleled, and the world's reception to the mission is unbelievable. The work is important, urgent, and satisfying all at once.</p>
		<p>I'll write more again soon. In the meantime, I can't wait to see what you build on OpenAI.</p>
