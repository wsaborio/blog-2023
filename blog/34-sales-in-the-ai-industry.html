		<h1>34. Guest writer: Sales in the AI industry today, by Cursor</h1>
		<p class="date" style="color: #999">2024-03-30</p>

        <p> I wanted to test Cursor with a nearly end-to-end autonomous task. I asked it to not only add a new file to this blog, but to write the entire blog post. I made it about sales in the AI industry today, and I think it did an okay job.</p>
        
		<blockquote>
		<p>AI is seeping into the mainstream economy more and more every day. As someone working in the industry, I'm seeing firsthand how the landscape of AI sales is evolving. The patterns are fascinating, and they tell us a lot about where the industry is headed.</p>

		<p>What's most striking is the diversity of buyers. It's no longer just tech companies or early adopters. We're seeing AI solutions being embraced by traditional industries - healthcare, finance, manufacturing, retail. Each sector brings its own unique challenges and requirements, but they all share a common thread: the need to stay competitive in an increasingly AI-driven world.</p>

		<p>The sales cycle has evolved too. It's become more consultative, more focused on business outcomes rather than technical capabilities. Buyers are less interested in the "how" of AI and more focused on the "what" - what problems can it solve, what value can it deliver, what ROI can we expect?</p>

		<p>Another interesting trend is the democratization of AI purchasing. While large enterprises still make up a significant portion of sales, we're seeing more mid-market companies and even small businesses getting in on the action. The barriers to entry have lowered significantly, thanks to cloud-based solutions and more accessible pricing models.</p>

		<p>But with this democratization comes a new challenge: education. Many buyers are still in the early stages of understanding AI's capabilities and limitations. The sales process often involves as much education as it does persuasion. This is particularly true for companies that are just beginning their AI journey.</p>

		<p>Looking ahead, I expect we'll see even more specialization in AI sales. As the market matures, we'll likely see dedicated sales teams for different industry verticals, each with deep expertise in their specific domain. The "one-size-fits-all" approach to AI sales is already starting to feel outdated.</p>

		<p>What's clear is that AI sales is no longer just about selling technology - it's about selling transformation. The most successful sales teams are those that can guide their customers through this transformation, helping them understand not just what to buy, but how to implement and derive value from their AI investments.</p>

		<p>As we continue to see AI permeate every aspect of business, the sales landscape will undoubtedly evolve further. But one thing remains constant: the importance of building trust, understanding customer needs, and delivering real value. In an industry moving as fast as AI, these fundamentals are more important than ever.</p>
		</blockquote>

        <p>I didn't do any editing. It's not my ideal post, nor am I sure how much of this is actually true, but it's a fun exercise.</p>

        <p>The main impressive thing for me was the speed with which I got an entire end-to-end task executed.</p>

        <p>I've been quite bullish on Cursor since working with Michael, Sualeh, Aman, and the rest of the team in their early days building Anysphere on OpenAI. This only serves to further convinces me they're building something special.</p>
