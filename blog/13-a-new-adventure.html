		<h1>13. A new adventure</h1>
        <p class="date" style="color: #999">2018-05-06</p>

		<p>I mentioned a few weeks back that I was looking for work in San Francisco. I’m happy to report that search was pretty successful! I joined <a href="https://www.checkr.com">Checkr</a> as a Solutions Engineer a couple of weeks ago and it’s been a pretty awesome experience so far.</p>

		<p>So what am I doing? The new Solutions team is interesting in that it serves both customer and Checkr teams. For clients we manage larger-scale product integrations, design new solutions as customer needs shift, and advise developers in leveraging the Checkr API. Internally we serve as an information and coordination hub, ensuring our sales and customer success teams have the product knowledge they need, and our product team has a finger on the client pulse. In sum, we’re some glue as Checkr scales rapidly.</p>

		<p>It’s fascinating and impactful work, at a quickly growing company, with top notch people. It also hits squarely at my interest in the new world of HR tech, which has been exciting to delve into.</p>

		<p>If you want to learn more about Checkr’s mission to build a fairer hiring future, check out <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-startup-that-will-vet-you-for-your-next-job">this recent Wired article</a> about our work. We’re also hiring! Reach out if you have questions about any of <a href="https://checkr.com/careers/">our open roles</a>.</p>

		<p>More writing coming soon.</p>
